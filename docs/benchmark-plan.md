# Native database benchmarks

Benchmark the current append-only pack engine, not alternate physical
backends. Always use a fresh randomly named parent directory; tests must
never reuse an existing repository path.

## Canonical hydraulic models

Use the Release build of the real AOWIS hydraulic persistence benchmark:

```bash
run_root="$(mktemp -d /tmp/aowis-hydraulic-bench.XXXXXXXX)"
./build-linux-tests-release/aowis-dvmdb-hydraulic-edit-benchmark \
  "$run_root/network" 100000 20 3
```

Record initial import time, indexed entity edits, topology changes,
whole-network operations, peak RSS, branch/merge behavior, and disk usage.
Use representative networks and several repetitions. Compiler build mode,
cache state and hardware must be included with results.

## Replication

`tools/benchmark_replication_scaling.py` produces deterministic raw and model
histories for the pack format. Split source preparation from import runs to
avoid mixing fixture construction with importer latency:

```bash
fixture_root="$(mktemp -d /tmp/aowis-replication-fixture.XXXXXXXX)"
rmdir "$fixture_root"
python3 tools/benchmark_replication_scaling.py \
  --binary ./build-linux-tests-release/aowis-dvmdb-replication-scaling-benchmark \
  --objects 100000 --commits 20 --payload-bytes 96 \
  --kinds model --backends pack --mode prepare \
  --fixture-dir "$fixture_root" --progress

python3 tools/benchmark_replication_scaling.py \
  --binary ./build-linux-tests-release/aowis-dvmdb-replication-scaling-benchmark \
  --objects 100000 --commits 20 --payload-bytes 96 \
  --kinds model --backends pack --repeats 3 --mode imports \
  --fixture-dir "$fixture_root" --output "$fixture_root/results.csv"
```

The CSV includes full and incremental import timings, native verification
phases, independent full-integrity audit time, import peak RSS, transferred
object counts, pack size, and sampled temporary-file allocations. Results
are checked against the expected immutable revision heads. Each import
uses a new disposable repository; the fixture can be retained for reruns.

## Recovery, concurrency and maintenance

`aowis-dvmdb-pack-operational-stress-tests` covers multiple simultaneous
repository handles, readers/writers, stale edits, model merges, incremental
sync, compaction exclusivity and reopening. `aowis-dvmdb-recovery-tests`
adds deterministic crash and ENOSPC injection. Before public release also
run real power-failure and filesystem-specific tests where practical.

Report full repository verification and offline compaction separately.
Compaction is not supported while other handles are open. Measurements from
individual storage benchmarks are workload-specific and should not be used as
production guarantees.

## Physical object index

`aowis-dvmdb-index-scaling-benchmark` and `tools/benchmark_native_index.py`
measure the **existing** SHA-256-to-pack-location index. They do not
silently swap in a second storage engine. Use the optimized Release binary.
The driver **automatically rebuilds the exact Release target supplied in
`--binary`** before generating fixtures; it rejects Debug or foreign CMake
build trees. `./compile_linux.sh` builds `build-linux`, **not**
`build-linux-tests-release`. To do an explicit clean Release test build first,
run `./compile_linux_tests.sh --release`. The example below uses `build-linux`
so it also works after `./compile_linux.sh`:

```bash
run_root="$(mktemp -d /tmp/aowis-index-capacity.XXXXXXXX)"
python3 tools/benchmark_native_index.py \
  --binary ./build-linux/aowis-dvmdb-index-scaling-benchmark \
  --sizes 100000,1000000,10000000 \
  --keys 4096 --batch 1024 --reads 1000 --write-rounds 5 \
  --multi-projects 2 --work-root "$run_root" \
  --output "$run_root/index-capacity.csv"
```

For deliberately comparing already-built historical binaries, `--no-build`
skips the automatic rebuild; use it only when that is intentional. Smoke tests
run as part of CTest and do not invoke a nested CMake build.

For a quick validation of the benchmark itself, run
`ctest --test-dir build-linux-tests-release -R aowis-dvmdb-index-scaling-smoke
--output-on-failure`. The benchmark driver creates randomized disposable
subdirectories, refuses existing fixture paths, and removes fixtures after
sampling. **It never modifies an existing user repository.** Rebuild,
compaction and commit phases run on independent *copies* of the fixture.
Large runs require free space for these copies and temporary compacted packs.
Do not run benchmarks on a volume with production repositories or tight disk
budgets. Use `--skip-rebuild` and `--skip-compact` to measure indexing at 10M
objects first without paying for full-pack hashing or maintenance. Use
`--repeats 3` for independent repetitions. The CSV is atomically updated after each completed target/repetition;
partial results from completed targets survive later failures. An interrupted
target does not produce a misleading partial phase row. To assess sparsity, repeat with different `--keys` values,
for example 256 and 65536 at the same physical object targets.

Each row reports a separate process and phase:

- `prepare`: deterministic fixture creation until at least the requested
  **physical** object count. `physical_objects` includes old revision/tree
  objects, not just live model records. It reports durable pack and sidecar
  sizes, creation time, and current/peak RSS.
- `reopen`: fresh-process startup from the intact sidecar, subsequent checksummed
  reads of present UUIDs and misses, current memory before/after construction,
  and process peak RSS. Average read latency is
  `lookup_hit_ms / samples` or `lookup_miss_ms / samples`.
- `rebuild`: identical copy with **only the derived index sidecar removed**;
  measures full verified pack scanning and sidecar recreation. Asserts the
  object count and branch head are unchanged.
- `compact`, `post_compaction_reopen`, `writes`: separately copied fixtures;
  compaction preserves the complete published revision history. Writes report
  mean and p95 latency per fixed-size atomic commit. Phase peaks are not
  polluted by earlier phases.
- `multi_project_open`: multiple physically independent copies held open
  simultaneously in one process. The dynamic `rss_project_N_bytes` columns
  show resident growth as each additional repository is opened.

These measurements are **warm or uncontrolled OS-page-cache** timings,
not guaranteed cold-cache disk latency. For a meaningful 100k/1m/10m
comparison, record CPU, memory capacity, filesystem, storage media,
Linux kernel, build flags, available disk space, run repetitions and whether
cache was cold. `VmRSS` and `VmHWM` come from `/proc/self/status` and are
subject to page granularity, allocator retention and process overhead;
`rss_after_open_bytes - rss_before_bytes` estimates map-related resident
memory but is not an isolated allocator measurement. Record the actual
`physical_objects` value because batches can overshoot the requested target.

**Retain the compact sidecar-backed index** unless reproducible benchmarks establish a regression or stronger alternative. The before/after evidence and assumptions are recorded in [engineering findings](engineering-findings.md). Any future changes must preserve pack integrity and publication guarantees. This benchmark does not yet qualify cold-cache reads, sustained
production mixed workloads, or network-service contention.

## Sustained HTTP resource envelope

For repeatable Linux process measurements, run the existing real HTTP bundle
soak through `tools/qualify_http_resources.py` rather than scraping PID values
from a separately launched server. It measures the same six-client/three-project
workload, saves a raw observation CSV, an immutable-per-run JSON summary and
the original soak log under a fresh `build-qualification/http-resources-*`
directory. Two same-binary, 300-second operator runs now form a measured
baseline: 50.03 and 49.73 combined transfers/s; approximately 28.1 MiB peak
sampled server RSS in both, with 37 peak open descriptors and zero admission
503s. A subsequent 3,600-second run completed **67,747 imports and
67,747 exports**, zero admission 503s and a 35.4 MiB sampled RSS peak at
**37.64 transfers/s**. The lower hour-long average could not be assigned to
history-growth cost or external contention without per-minute progress data.
A later 900-second run **with** checkpoints exhibited a 63.28/s to 41.75/s
first-to-last-minute decline as branch refs accumulated. This exposed a
single-branch lookup path that scanned the entire branch catalogue. After
switching to direct regular-ref lookups, another 900-second run completed
28,675 import/export pairs, at 63.72 combined transfers/s versus 54.14/s
previously. Its first/last-minute rates were 64.82/s and 63.10/s. The before
and after reports have different executable hashes and were not instrumented
for background host load, so this is useful evidence, not a controlled
portable speedup estimate. The saved before/after reports remain useful.
The subsequently completed **optimized 3,600-second** run retained the same
Release executable hashes as the post-change 900-second run: 110,733
imports and exports each (221,466 transfers, **61.52/s**), **zero 503s**,
28.0 MiB peak sampled server RSS and 10 ms worst health latency. Quarter-hour
throughput averages were **62.01 / 58.70 / 61.56 / 63.81 transfers/s**,
showing no sustained decline with the growing branch catalogue. This run
used different binaries from the previous uninstrumented 3,600-second run,
and does not establish a portable 63.5% causal speedup claim. Detailed
figures and caveats are retained in [engineering findings](engineering-findings.md).

These are observed workloads, not resource guarantees. Run additional longer
periods (e.g. 21600 seconds) only if relevant to deployment workloads, and
prioritize representative hydraulic model traffic, actual disk use and cold
reopening on target hardware. The stress harness now prints one-minute
import/export checkpoints to `soak.log` without extra HTTP requests. Use
`tools/analyze_http_resource_runs.py` to validate saved JSON/CSV/log evidence,
compare throughput and central-window RSS medians, and report within-run
minute-by-minute transfer rates, first-to-last interval changes and
four time-weighted quarter-run throughput averages when checkpoints are
available. The analysis explicitly distinguishes same-binary
repeats from ordered cross-build comparisons, and reports ordered overall
throughput change without implying causal attribution. For example, on the
operator's Linux machine with the original run directories still present:

```bash
python3 tools/analyze_http_resource_runs.py \
  build-qualification/http-resources-ha2jc118 \
  build-qualification/http-resources-m5po2jr0

# A longer same-binary trend on the optimized build:
python3 tools/analyze_http_resource_runs.py \
  build-qualification/http-resources-lqle9235
```

Older run logs have only total throughput; their per-minute history cannot
be inferred. Keep original run directories because their raw CSV, JSON and
soak log evidence are required by the analysis tool.
Do not presume linear memory growth. See
[durability qualification](durability-qualification.md) for commands and
interpretation limits.

The existing fixture exercises multi-MiB bundle transfers and increasing
branch counts. It is **not** a replacement for representative hydraulic
model reads/writes, large object deltas, high-divergence merges, disk I/O
profiling or real-world client latency. Record those separately before
publishing a deployment resource envelope.

## Representative canonical hydraulic workload qualification

The existing `aowis-dvmdb-hydraulic-edit-benchmark` uses **real serialized
NetworkHydraulic objects**, not the synthetic model-record topology benchmark.
It now also measures indexed pipe reads, complete network reconstruction,
divergent-branch diff, a validated two-parent hydraulic field merge, and
pack/index growth from initial import to completion. It verifies that
nonconflicting fields survive merging and that an immutable pre-merge revision
can still be read. See [hydraulic merging](native-hydraulic-merging.md) for
conflict semantics.

Build the actual **Release** targets and run repeated independent fixtures:

```bash
cmake --build build-linux-tests-release --target \
  aowis-dvmdb-hydraulic-edit-benchmark aowis-dvmdb-verify --parallel
python3 tools/qualify_hydraulic_workload.py \
  --binary ./build-linux-tests-release/aowis-dvmdb-hydraulic-edit-benchmark \
  --verifier ./build-linux-tests-release/aowis-dvmdb-verify \
  --pipes 10000 --edits 20 --topology-edits 3 --repeats 3
```

To compare multiple DVMDB-native Release runs, use the offline analyzer:

```bash
python3 tools/qualify_hydraulic_workload.py \
  --pipes 10000 --edits 20 --topology-edits 3 --repeats 3
python3 tools/qualify_hydraulic_workload.py \
  --pipes 50000 --edits 20 --topology-edits 3 --repeats 3
python3 tools/qualify_hydraulic_workload.py \
  --pipes 100000 --edits 20 --topology-edits 3 --repeats 3
python3 tools/analyze_hydraulic_workloads.py \
  build-qualification/hydraulic-workload-<10k-run> \
  build-qualification/hydraulic-workload-<50k-run> \
  build-qualification/hydraulic-workload-<100k-run> \
  --csv build-qualification/hydraulic-size-comparison.csv
```

Replace the placeholders with the actual output directory names. The comparison
requires matching benchmark/verifier SHA-256 hashes and edit counts; because
its executable identity changed during the DVMDB API rename, do **not** mix
pre-rename 10K evidence with fresh DVMDB runs. Each benchmark run has a fresh
disposable repository and removes its own fixtures on success.

The runner saves a unique `build-qualification/hydraulic-workload-*/report.json`
and the original benchmark and verifier logs. Every repetition uses a brand-new
repository, verifies its **complete native repository integrity from a new
process**, and checks that reported physical pack/index sizes match on-disk
bytes. Each executable's SHA-256 is recorded. By default it removes
**only its freshly created disposable repository directories** on success;
use `--keep-fixtures` when investigating a particular case. A failed run
retains the fixture and diagnostics. Do not run against actual project data.

The result field `fresh_process_reopen_full_verify_ms` measures **process
startup + repository reopening + full logical/physical verification** together,
not pure open latency. The OS page cache is not cleared, so it must **not** be
called a cold-cache disk benchmark. Internal `full_network_read_ms` is a
separate warm in-process canonical reconstruction. Pack and index growth
includes all tested operations, including revision/branch overhead. Every
iteration's raw metrics remain available in `report.json`; no absolute latency
or memory threshold is implied by this fixture. It is a linear chain of pipes
with representative entity types and deterministic edits—not a field-derived
real water network or a concurrent GUI session. Run with several network sizes
and actual project fixtures before claiming deployment representativeness.

The normal Qt-enabled CTest suite includes a small end-to-end hydraulic
workload smoke and an additional Qt-free, offline runner-contract regression.
The smoke only verifies semantic correctness, never a performance SLA.
